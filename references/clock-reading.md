# Understanding scan clocks in STIL (reference only)

This reference preserves the taught interpretation using **synthetic pin/chain names**. It is not a period specification and is not executed by the pin checker.

## Evidence chain

1. Read each `ScanChain`'s `ScanMasterClock` to identify its scan clock. Multiple clocks are possible; do not hard-code one pin name.
2. Resolve the pin's position in ordered `SignalGroups` (for example `_pi_`), including referenced groups if present. Being an input does not prove a fixed index. If a particular `_pi_` ends with `... + "SCAN_CLK" + "AUX_OUT"`, SCAN_CLK is second from last **only in that group**.
3. Expand data notation such as `\r538 0` (538 repetitions of 0), then map waveform characters to ordered group members. Preserve X/Z and other waveform characters; they are not simply binary levels.
4. Track the active `W <table>` and applicable `Timing`/`Spec Category` selection. Resolve `Period` and waveform expressions against the correct category rather than selecting a name such as RETARGET unconditionally.
5. Resolve the clock's waveform group and the character assigned by the current vector or macro. A waveform character `1` may encode an entire pulse, not a constant high level.

## Vector inheritance

`V { ... }` is a vector execution. `V {}` also executes a vector, inheriting applicable prior waveform-character assignments. Pins omitted from a vector retain their assignments under the applicable STIL execution context. An empty vector does not imply the clock stops: an inherited pulsing character can execute again. Track the active waveform table as well; inheritance of a character does not by itself prove unchanged edge timing.

## MacroDefs, Macro and Shift

Synthetic example:

```stil
MacroDefs {
  "scan_shift" {
    W scan_table;
    Shift { V { "scan_channel" = #; "SCAN_CLK" = 1; } }
    W scan_table;
  }
}
```

The `Macro "scan_shift" { ... }` call supplies data to `#` in the corresponding definition. In this simple one-vector Shift body, the supplied channel bit strings expand **in parallel** to shift vectors: one position from each channel per shift iteration, not all channels concatenated. Validate the actual Shift body, lengths and padding rules for other cases; not every macro has this structure.

Here `SCAN_CLK = 1` is assigned explicitly in the repeated Shift vector. It is not merely a one-time initialization. Each expanded shift vector executes waveform character 1 for that clock. A Macro call only implies clock toggling when its actual definition, execution and selected waveform establish this; unrelated macros may not toggle any clock.

## Numerical example (not a requirement)

Suppose the clock belongs to `input_time_gen_1` and the applicable Category specifies:

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---:|
| Time_force_pi | 0 ps |
| Time_measure_po | 2000 ps |
| Time_pulse_1 | 3000 ps |
| Time_pulse_2 | 5000 ps |
| Time_period | 10000 ps |
| strobe_window_tmp | 1 ps |

```stil
Period 'Time_period';
input_time_gen_1 {
  01 { 'Time_force_pi' D; 'Time_pulse_1' D/U;
       'Time_pulse_1+Time_pulse_2' D; }
}
```

The `01` characters map positionally to D/U at Time_pulse_1. For character `1`:

- 0 ns: drive low (D).
- 3 ns: drive high (U).
- 8 ns: drive low (D).
- 10 ns: vector period ends.

Thus consecutive shift vectors using character 1 produce one pulse per 10 ns vector, with 5 ns high time. Character 0 stays low in this example. Distinguish pulse width from repetition period. A 10 ns WaveformTable alone does not prove a clock toggles every 10 ns: assignments, macros, loops and selected tables matter.

## Reporting guardrails

- Explain actual clock identity and transitions from the inspected file; do not infer from unrelated TX/RX names.
- Do not label the numerical example as required timing.
- TCK/period conformance is intentionally outside the automated checker.
- This knowledge can be used to answer clock questions even though pin checking has no clock PASS/FAIL result.
